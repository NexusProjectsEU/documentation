## 6. Important Guidelines

### Waiting Period Between Applications
- If your application is denied, you must typically wait **30 days** before applying again
- Respect this waiting period - repeated applications before the time is up may lead to longer blocks

### Serious Violations
- Some blocks for very serious violations will rarely be lifted
- This typically includes: fraud, hacking, severe harassment, or repeated violations

### Honesty is Crucial
- Lying or providing misinformation in your application will almost always lead to denial
- If we discover dishonesty, it may extend your block
