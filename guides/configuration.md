# Configuration Guide

This guide will walk you through configuring ProteX to tailor its security features to your server's specific needs.

---

## 1. Access the Configuration Panel
1. **Sign In**: Log in to your ProteX Dashboard using Discord at [nxpdev.dk/dashboard/server](https://nxpdev.dk/dashboard/server).
2. **Select Your Server**: From the dashboard, choose the server you wish to configure.
3. **Navigate to Settings**: Click the `Configure Server` button to configure your server.

---

## 2. Basic Configuration
- **Enable ProteX**: Toggle the switch to activate ProteX protection for your server.
- **Blacklist Settings**: Choose whether to block users based on active blacklist entries.
- **Notification Preferences**: Set up alerts for new blacklist detections (e.g., via server logs).

> **Note**: Ensure your Discord bot has the necessary permissions (e.g., `Ban Members`) to enforce these settings.

## 3. Save and Test
1. Click **Save Changes** to apply your configuration.
2. Test the setup by inviting a test user (with a known blacklist status) to verify that ProteX responds correctly.
